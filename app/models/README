Add your ActiveRecord models here.

You can create them by being in the application root directory and running, e.g.,

rake generate:model NAME=User
rake generate:model NAME=Post
rake generate:model NAME=Comment
rake generate:migration NAME=create_users
rake generate:migration NAME=create_posts
rake generate:migration NAME=create_comments
